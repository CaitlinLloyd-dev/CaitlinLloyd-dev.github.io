  <h1>Caitlin Lloyd</h1>
  <p><strong>Junior Software Developer</strong></p>

  <div class="statement"> 
    <p>
    I am starting my career in software development. I'm transitioning from a background in healthcare and administration but have been interested in development for some time. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Over the last year, I have completed introduction courses for python, web development languages and C#. I am currently building on this foundational knowledge through a self-directed intermediate course for C#. I have begun to create my own projects and stretch my skills but I feel I am ready to start a trainee level position or an apprenticeship where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute to a development team.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have proven, through my varied work experience, that I'm versatile and flexible in my skillset. Notable skills are strong problem-solving, excellent communication, and experience managing complex tasks in high-pressure environments.
