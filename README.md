# About Me

I am an aspiring Junior Software Developer transitioning into tech from a background in healthcare and administration.

Over the past year, I have completed introductory courses in Python, C#, and web development fundamentals. I am currently building on this foundation through self-directed learning and hands-on projects, with the aim of securing a trainee or apprenticeship-level position where I can continue to grow and contribute to a development team.

Alongside technical skills, I bring strong problem-solving abilities, clear communication, and experience working effectively in high-pressure environments.

# Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

Git & GitHub

GitHub Pages (for hosting)

# Projects

Project links will be added to the site as they are completed.

Planned projects include:

Python console applications (beginner to intermediate)

C# console applications

Small projects focused on clean code, logic, and problem-solving

Each project will have its own repository with a detailed README explaining the purpose of the project, technologies used and what I learned while building it

# Purpose of This Website
This portfolio website was created to practice core web development skills, demonstrate consistent learning and self-motivation, provide a central place for employers to view my work and support applications for junior developer and apprenticeship roles.

The site is intentionally kept simple, with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and content over design complexity.
